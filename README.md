I'm a stuedent at Cedar High School. I moved here in 2017, and am the oldest of 9 children. I'm the general Sterling Scholar for Southwest Utah, as well as an Eagle Scout and FBLA National Champion. 
I'm taking Southwest Tech's software development classes to help me learn applicable skills that will help me place in the workforce after graduating high school.
